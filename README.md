# JiveJournal

In dance practice, we often make videos and take notes. However, navigating large video collections alone can be cumbersome with native tools in the mobile OS. The problem compounds with the addition of notes, which should be conveniently coupled with relevant videos. Again, native mobile tools fall short in offerring the necessary flexibility and intuitiveness of a coherent solution. 

JiveJournal fills this tooling gap with
* Separation from broad-purpose mobile notes applications, simplifying access to dance content
* User-defined tagging and filtering, tailoring your organizational scheme to your preferences
* Proximity between text and video content, saving time navigating between the two

As a Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile project, JiveJournal will be available on both iOS and Android platforms. This way, the shared internal logic creates a consistent cross-platform experience which leverages native mobile tools.
